# coloc_pipeline
---
This pipeline will made by myself, with 'ColocQuiaL' as a reference. We hope to make a highly efficiency and easy to implied pipeline.
Top of all, our pipeline will contain the function below:
- auto liftover
- coloc susie
- harmonize data
- auto visualize plot
- fast and easy to handle lots of GWAS datasets with QTL datasets

## Quick to start
okay, this will be the final parts to write.
I will keep it blank here first.

## Reference data
To fast liftover between hg19 and hg38 coordinate version, we collect the public data from plink to use as reference:
1KG 2508 hg19 plink format (rsid)
1KG 3202 hg38 plink format (rsid)
When download first in plink2 format, we need to simply process data first:
```bash
# unzip
# remove related samples
# remove rare variants and check Hardy-Winberg Rule
# remove duplicated variants
```
To achieve fast liftover, we use snp151 hash table here (same with ColocQuiaL):

## Configure your data
Before all we satrt, we need to make at least 3 configure file here, to offer the fundation info of the pipeline:

## Running
